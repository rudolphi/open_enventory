<p>This system was created to minimize the effort for ordering new chemicals and administrate existing.
<p>Chemicals available in the own group can be stored within the database to easily find the chemicals required. Search criteria are e.g. name, CAS registry number or chemical (sub-)structures that can be entered using a JAVA applet.
<p>In addition to the own chemicals, you can also check the inventories of other groups, the chemicals storage and online databases of commercial suppliers. The current prices can be directly compared.
When ordering a chemical, the physical and safety data can be transferred to the own database with one mouse click. Only size and place must be entered manually once.
The electronic inventory system shows physical and safety data of all molecules, allows to enter the actual amount available and to print safety data sheets offered by the suppliers as well as labels. The intention is to make safe working in the lab easy. 
<p>To minimize the time need when searching for chemicals, it is inevitable that new packages are always stored within the database, empty vessels be deleted and borrowed ones mark as such. This minimal contribution is required.
<p>A direct connection to the ordering system at the chemicals storage and the extension by an adaptable electronic lab journal with graphical reaction equations, spectroscopic data and literature database is still in development.
<p>We wish you a good time working with our new inventory database!
